<h3 align="left"><font color= #04942b>Introduction</font></h3>
    
In todays market, mobile phones come in a wide range of prices, each offering different features and specifications. For consumers, selecting a mobile phone that aligns with their budget and requirements can be challenging. To assist consumers in making informed decisions, this project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify mobile phones into different price ranges based on their features.

<h3 align="left"><font color= #04942b>Problem Statement</font></h3>
The task is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify mobile phones into predefined price ranges based on various attributes such as battery power, camera features, memory, connectivity options, and more. The dataset provided contains information about several mobile phones, including their specifications and corresponding price ranges.

<h3 align="left"><font color= #04942b>Objectives</font></h3>

- Explore and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and any other data inconsistencies.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (price range).
- Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification and evaluate their performance using suitable metrics.
- Fine-tune the chosen model to improve its predictive accuracy.
- Validate the final model using cross-validation techniques to ensure its robustness.
- Deploy the model for real-time predictions if applicable.
